Vision
	Camer: Kinect v2
	how to interface
	- 1) https://github.com/Kinect/PyKinect2 
		- is very old and not maintained, does not work with python > 3.7
		- 2) updated forks exist, cant pip install that though... (https://github.com/SujithChristopher/PyKinect2)
	- 3) https://github.com/nikwl/kinect-toolbox seems somewhat new, not popular
	
 --> Use fork option (2)

SLAM
https://silenceoverflow.github.io/Awesome-SLAM/#VISLAM
- dense
	https://github.com/gradslam/gradslam
	https://github.com/tum-vision/dvo_slam
- sparse
	would rather not use sparse because of having to extract features

Registration
- need to register the depth map to the color map
- TUM Dataset does it with weird old software(https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/file_formats) 
- Solutiont: use kinect onboard Registration
